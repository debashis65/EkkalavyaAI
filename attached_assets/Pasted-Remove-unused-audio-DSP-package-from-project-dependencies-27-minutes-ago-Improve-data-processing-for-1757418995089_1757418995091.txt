Context for New Chat: Ekkalavya Sports AI Platform
Current Project State
Platform: Ekkalavya Sports AI Training Platform - comprehensive sports training ecosystem with dual AR systems, AI-powered analysis, and multi-platform deployment (React web app + Flutter mobile + Unity AR + FastAPI AI backend + PostgreSQL)

Overall Completion: ~85% complete - substantially functional but needs focused work on remaining gaps

Major Accomplishments Completed
✅ AI Backend Core - Replaced 15+ placeholder methods with real biomechanical calculations
✅ Authentication System - Complete JWT/session-based auth with 2FA support
✅ Frontend Integration - Real pose analysis replacing hardcoded values (0.5, 0.3, 75)
✅ Sport Action Recognition - Genuine biomechanical analysis for shooting, serving, running
✅ Context Understanding - Dynamic confidence scoring based on data quality
✅ Unity AR Bridge - Full WebSocket communication with real-time tracking
✅ Database Integration - PostgreSQL with comprehensive sports analytics schema
✅ Cross-Platform Sync - Web ↔ Flutter data synchronization working
Critical Issues Identified (Needs Immediate Work)
High Priority Blockers:
Ball Possession Detection - ai_backend/multi_object_tracker.py:281 - Method _get_possession_candidate() returns None instead of implementing player-ball distance analysis
Sport Overlay Renderers - ai_backend/dynamic_overlay_renderer.py - Missing implementations for tennis, football, volleyball overlays (return None)
LSP Diagnostic Error - Active type error in ai_backend/dynamic_overlay_renderer.py needs resolution
Abstract Method Implementation - ai_backend/unified_cv_pipeline.py:90,95,100 - Abstract methods with pass statements
Medium Priority Issues:
Sport Coverage Imbalance - Basketball fully implemented, other major sports lack depth
Error Handling - Some components return None on errors without meaningful fallbacks
Object Detection Fallbacks - Basic OpenCV detection needs more sophisticated algorithms
Current Task List Status:
All 10 tasks are marked as "pending" - none started in new chat:

Fix ball possession detection (return None → real algorithm)
Implement missing sport overlay renderers (None returns → actual overlays)
Fix error handling (generic None → meaningful fallbacks)
Complete abstract method implementations
Enhance sport coverage beyond basketball
Fix LSP diagnostic error
Implement robust object detection fallbacks
Add comprehensive testing/validation
Optimize performance for production
Final production readiness verification
Technical Stack & Architecture
Web: React + TypeScript + Express.js + PostgreSQL
Mobile: Flutter + Unity AR integration
AI: FastAPI + MediaPipe + OpenCV + real biomechanical calculations
Auth: JWT + sessions + role-based access
Deployment: Replit (web) + production-ready configurations
Key File Locations of Issues:
ai_backend/multi_object_tracker.py (ball possession)
ai_backend/dynamic_overlay_renderer.py (overlays + LSP error)
ai_backend/unified_cv_pipeline.py (abstract methods)
ai_backend/sport_specific_detectors.py (detection fallbacks)
User Requirements Reminder:
Zero tolerance for placeholders, mock data, or incomplete implementations
Production-ready code only - no TODOs, no hardcoded values
Real calculations throughout - authentic biomechanical analysis
All 54+ sports should be fully supported with genuine configurations
Next Action:
Start with Task 1 - Fix ball possession detection in multi_object_tracker.py by replacing the return None with real player-ball distance analysis algorithm. This is blocking advanced tracking functionality.

Current Status: Both AI Backend and Web App workflows are running successfully. System is functional for basic operations but needs completion of advanced features for full production deployment.
