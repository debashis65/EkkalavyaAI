# Barogrip - AI-Powered 3D Foot Scanning & Diagnosis System

## Overview
Barogrip is a comprehensive medical-grade foot analysis platform that combines AI-powered diagnosis with real-time 3D scanning capabilities. It provides detailed biomechanical analysis, automated diagnosis, and personalized orthotic recommendations through a mobile-first interface, serving both healthcare professionals and patients globally. The project's mission is to democratize advanced foot health assessment, bringing specialist-level medical analysis to underserved populations worldwide using smartphone technology and clinical-grade AI validation.

**Current Status: 85% Production Ready** - Core medical functionality complete with real Cambridge FOUND AI validation, professional medical UI, backend API integration, and enterprise-grade architecture. Ready for clinical pilot programs and beta testing.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language
- **Project Vision**: Focus on real-world medical impact and helping people who lack access to advanced healthcare
- **Development Philosophy**: Build genuine medical-grade solutions, not prototypes or demos
- **Quality Standards**: Production-ready implementations with real AI validation and clinical workflows

## System Architecture

### Multi-Service Architecture
The application uses a distributed architecture with three main services:
- **Backend API Server**: Handles authentication, data processing, and API endpoints (Node.js/Express).
- **Frontend Client**: User interface for patients and doctors (React/Vite).
- **AI Processor**: Computer vision and machine learning analysis pipeline (Python).

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **AI/ML**: Python with TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with session-based auth, JWT token support, 2FA.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections
- **File Processing**: Multer for image uploads
- **Report Generation**: HTML templates with PDF export capability

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a medical-grade UI with clinical color schemes (blues/greens), professional terminology, precision indicators, and smooth animations. It includes an interactive AR Foot Scan Tutorial with 3D animated guidance and a Voice-Guided Scan Positioning Assistant for a hands-free, automated capture experience. Professional instruction cards and hospital-grade status panels provide real-time confidence metrics and stability indicators.

### Key Features & Technical Implementations
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Session-based with PostgreSQL, role-based access control (Patient, Doctor, Admin), 2FA, account lockout.
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive schema including Users, Patient Profiles, Doctor Profiles, Scans, Scan Images, Prescriptions, Consultations, and Audit Logs.
- **AI Processing Pipeline**: Modular analysis models for arch type, pronation, pressure distribution, and deformities. Utilizes OpenCV for computer vision, generates pressure heatmaps and 3D models (OBJ/STL), and employs a diagnostic rule engine for orthotic recommendations. The Cambridge University FOUND model is the primary detection model, with HRNet as a fallback.
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket for live scan status updates, background processing, and automatic processing triggers.
- **Scan Processing Workflow**: Image upload, validation, queuing, AI analysis, report generation, and user notification.
- **Mobile Scanning System**: Implemented a professional medical scanning system with depth-based automatic foot capture (iOS TrueDepth + LiDAR, Android ToF/Structured Light/Dual Camera). It supports multi-capture per angle (3 photos per angle) for superior analysis, totaling 36 images (6 angles × 2 feet × 3 captures). It features a hands-free automated capture system that emphasizes placing the phone on a flat surface while the user changes positions.
- **Hybrid Foot Detection System**: Combines object detection, color/edge detection, and motion detection with a weighted approach (Object 50%, Color/Edge 30%, Motion 20%) for clinical distances (50-100cm).
- **Validation Pipeline**: Integrates a Cambridge FOUND Validation Service for post-capture image validation, preceding backend upload.
- **AR/CV Hybrid**: Combines ARKit/ARCore with traditional computer vision methods, prioritizing AR detection when available.
- **Analytics & Performance Monitoring**: Real-time medical scanning analytics with comprehensive event tracking (scan sessions, capture events, validation results, upload status, errors, and performance metrics). Firebase Analytics integration ready with WordPress-style debug management system.
- **Production Management**: WordPress-style debug control system allowing instant production mode toggle. One-line change silences all debug output across the application.
- **Security**: Includes R8 obfuscation fixes, ProGuard rules for essential ML classes, and robust error handling.
